                    <p>I attended a Series 7 course with many other students to prep for our upcoming test. Our class was very close and interactive - we studied together, shares notes and helped eachother out.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the course, I was scheduled to take the exam that upcoming Friday which was the first in the class. All of my classmates wished me luck and told me to let them know how I did and give them pointers.</p>
                    <p>I know that there was no way to reach back out to let my classmates know the results and what to focus on. Root would provide a platfrom that would connect our class during the class, and act as a way to stay in touch.</p>

                    <p>Every Tuesday, I play in an adult hockey league. This inevitable means that on Tuesday's at around 2PM, I am bombarded with annoying emails - first from the team manager, then from each player letting everyone know if they're IN or OUT for the game. </p>
                    <p>Every week it's the same. The simple IN or OUT turns into a friendly trash-talking email chain between teammates. For the remainder of the afernoon, I get emails about how bad Steve was last week and how he "couldn't finish a hooker."</p>
                    <p>This being the 21st century and millenial, I am used to constant notifications. The only problem is when I go back to look at the chain, it is confusing and out of order. I can't tell who send what and when. Additionally, who the heck is 'hockey4lyfe@aol.com'?.</p>
                    <p>Root would let us take our team email chain to a new, simple yet more orgaized platform. A new chat could be started each week that functions as seamless as a groupchat. Furthermore, each player has their real name and profile pic so you'll never forget which Steve sucks at hockey.</p>
